/*
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]

Output: 4

package main

// longestConsecutive returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Creates a set of numbers and iterates through the set to find the longest consecutive sequence

func longestConsecutive(nums []int) int {
	numSet := make(map[int]bool)
	for _, num := range nums {
		numSet[num] = true
	}

	longestStreak := 0
	for num := range numSet {
		if !numSet[num-1] {
			currentNum := num
			currentStreak := 1

			for numSet[currentNum+1] {
				currentNum++
				currentStreak++
			}

			if currentStreak > longestStreak {
				longestStreak = currentStreak
